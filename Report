ECEN 4008: Embedded AI Final Project Report 
AI-Generated Image Detection Using CNN Classification
Team Members: Matteo Coscia, Katie Fleming, Sara Wissner, and Mel Strand

1. Project Goals 
Our project aimed to design and train a machine learning model capable of ditinguising between AI-generated images with real images, with explianable features to help users understand why the classifier made its prediction.
To achive this, we planned to:
- Identify and preproces a large dataset of real vs. AI-generated images 
- Implement a convolutional nueral network (CNN) 
- Train and evaluate the model in Google Colab or VS code 
- Build a reproducible pipeline and uplad all assets to a structured GitHUB repository 
- Generate visual explanations (e.g., Grad-CAM heatmaps) to highlight model reasoning 
- Identify areas we can improve the model for higher accuracy or efficiency
- Provide a small model demo / inference script

3. Final Model 

Key Takeaways & Learnings 
- Dataset quality matters more than architechture. Balanced real vs. fake images significantly improved performance.
- Transfer learning outperformed custom CNNs given limited compute time.
- Explainability tools are essential - Grad-CAM highlighted that real-image noise patterns differn from AI smoothing artifacts. 
- Preprocessing consistency (image size, normalization, augmentations) had a major effect on training stability.
- Running large experiments on Colab requires planning to avoid GPU resets and environmental consistencies.
- Version control and modular code structure made it easier to collaborate and track improvments.
